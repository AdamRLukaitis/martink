/**
 * A serial interface is any device that is capable of sending and receiving
 * data over some kind of channel. A serial interface is typically a stream
 * it is not a transaction based interface, but rather a stream based one. 
 * Data can usually be transfered in both directions and we do not use any 
 * kind of addressing scheme. A serial interface is a point to point channel
 * between two devices. 
 * 
 * Each of the interface methods takes the interface structure itself as first arg.
 * This pointer can later be converted to device specific context pointer using
 * container_of() macro (currently defined in util.h)
