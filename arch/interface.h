/**
 * A serial interface is any device that is capable of sending and receiving

 * kind of addressing scheme. A serial interface is a point to point channel

 * Each of the interface methods takes the interface structure itself as first arg.

 * A packet interface is similar to a serial interface but instead operates on

 * chunks, meaning that you either get or not get a packet - there is no possibility
 * to only get a partial packet.
 *
 * Packet interfaces are useful for message based communication schemes and bus
 * types that operates by means of "start -> data bytes -> stop" pattern. It
 * does not however handle addressing - this is the job of the underlying device
 * that this interface is used to access. All addressing and protocol data must
 * be passed inside the packet sent over this interface. This is another point
