/**
 * A serial interface is any device that is capable of sending and receiving
 * data over some kind of channel. A serial interface is typically a stream
 * it is not a transaction based interface, but rather a stream based one. 
 * Data can usually be transfered in both directions and we do not use any 
 * kind of addressing scheme. A serial interface is a point to point channel
 * between two devices. 
 * 
 * Each of the interface methods takes the interface structure itself as first arg.
 * This pointer can later be converted to device specific context pointer using
 * container_of() macro (currently defined in util.h)

/**
 * A packet interface is similar to a serial interface but instead operates on
 * chunks of data. Whereas a serial interface guarantees that you either get or
 * not get an individual byte of data, a packet interface does the same for
 * chunks, meaning that you either get or not get a packet - there is no possibility
 * to only get a partial packet.
 *
 * Packet interfaces are useful for message based communication schemes and bus
 * types that operates by means of "start -> data bytes -> stop" pattern. It
 * does not however handle addressing - this is the job of the underlying device
 * that this interface is used to access. All addressing and protocol data must
 * be passed inside the packet sent over this interface. This is another point
 * in which the packet device differs from a stream device.
