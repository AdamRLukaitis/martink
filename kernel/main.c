/**
 \mainpage LibK firmware development library

 <b>Introduction</b>

 LibK is a driver support library providing portable device driver
 support for embedded applications.

 It is distributed under the GNU General Public License - see the
 accompanying LICENSE.txt file for more details.

 It is designed to even be able to compile on a desktop. The future
 may very well involve using libk to use the same device drivers for
 both arduino and a linux based board that uses linux to access i2c
 ports and other ports. LibK can basically be compiled as a native
 library. All that is necessary to run it on any board is to
 implement the arch interface for that board. For a native version
 this layer would use linux system calls to access i2c or SPI ports
 instead of accessing hardware registers directly - but for the
 drivers it does not matter.
